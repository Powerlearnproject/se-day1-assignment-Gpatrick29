#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the application of engineering principles and techniques to design, develop, test, and maintain software systems. It involves a systematic approach to software development, ensuring that software meets requirements, is reliable, efficient, and meets user needs.

Software engineering is crucial in the technology industry as it:
- Ensures software quality and reliability
- Reduces development time and costs
- Improves maintainability and scalability
- Enhances user experience

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Key Milestones in Software Engineering Evolution
1. 1960s: Software crisis - recognition of software development challenges
2. 1970s: Introduction of structured programming and software life cycle models
3. 1980s: Emergence of object-oriented programming and software engineering methodologies

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Software Development Life Cycle Phases
1. Requirements gathering and analysis
2. Design
3. Implementation (coding)
4. Testing
5. Deployment
6. Maintenance

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall vs. Agile Methodologies
- Waterfall: Linear, sequential approach; suitable for projects with well-defined requirements
- Agile: Iterative, flexible approach; suitable for projects with changing requirements or high uncertainty

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Roles and Responsibilities
- Software Developer: Designs, develops, and tests software
- Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality through testing and validation
- Project Manager: Oversees project planning, execution, and delivery

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Importance of IDEs and VCS
- Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Enhance productivity and efficiency (e.g., Eclipse, Visual Studio)
- Version Control Systems (VCS): Manage code changes and collaborations (e.g., Git, SVN)

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Common Challenges and Strategies
- Challenges: Time management, communication, technical debt
- Strategies: Prioritize tasks, effective communication, continuous refactoring

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Types of Testing
1. Unit Testing:  Individual components
2. Integration Testing: Interactions between components
3. System Testing: Entire system
4. Acceptance Testing: User acceptance


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining input prompts to elicit specific, accurate, and relevant responses from AI models.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Example of Improved Prompt
- Vague Prompt: "Tell me something about dogs."
- Improved Prompt: "Provide a concise summary of the main characteristics of Golden Retrievers."
The improved prompt is more effective because it is clear, specific, and concise, allowing the AI model to provide a relevant and accurate response.
